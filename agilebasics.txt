Agile vs Waterfall methodology

## What is Agile?

Agile is a flexible approach to project management.
It breaks work into small, manageable pieces,
emphasizes quick delivery, teamwork, and constant improvement.
Agile teams work in short cycles, get feedback often,
and adapt quickly to changes.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Work in short cycles (1-4 weeks, called sprints)
- Deliver working results regularly
- Welcome changes throughout the project
- Focus on collaboration and communication
- Continuous improvement through regular feedback

## What is Waterfall?

Waterfall is a traditional, linear project management methodology.
Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
It follows a sequential approach with extensive planning upfront,
and limited flexibility for changes.

**The 6 Phases of Waterfall:**
1. **Requirements** – Gather and document all project needs
2. **Design** – Create detailed system architecture and design
3. **Implementation** – Build the product according to specifications
4. **Testing** – Test the complete product for defects
5. **Deployment** – Release the final product to users
6. **Maintenance** – Provide ongoing support and updates

**Key Characteristics:**
- Sequential phases with clear dependencies
- Extensive documentation at each stage
- Limited flexibility for changes once a phase is complete
- Testing happens after development is finished
- Single delivery at the end of the project

## Agile vs Waterfall: Key Differences

| **Aspect**             | Agile (Flexible & Iterative)                | Waterfall (Structured & Sequential)           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**           | Work in short cycles, adapt as needed       | Complete each phase before moving to next     |
| **Planning**           | Plans updated regularly                     | All planning done at the start                |
| **Changes**            | Easy to make changes anytime                | Hard to change after planning is done         |
| **Testing**            | Test as you build each part                 | Test only after everything is built           |
| **Client Involvement** | Clients give feedback often                 | Clients review mainly at the end              |
| **Documentation**      | Just enough to support teamwork             | Detailed documents for every phase            |
| **Delivery**           | Release working parts often                 | Deliver everything at the end                 |
| **Risk Management**    | Spot problems early in short cycles         | Problems may show up late in the process      |
| **Team Structure**     | Small teams, everyone helps with many tasks | Bigger teams, each person has a set role      |

## How Agile Works

1. Create a list of features or changes needed (backlog)
2. Choose a small set of tasks for the next sprint (1-4 weeks)
3. Build and test those tasks
4. Review completed work and get feedback
5. Hold retrospective to improve the process
6. Repeat the cycle, continuously improving

## How Waterfall Works

1. **Requirements Phase:** Gather all requirements and create detailed specifications
2. **Design Phase:** Create system architecture and detailed design documents
3. **Implementation Phase:** Code the entire solution based on designs
4. **Testing Phase:** Test the complete system for bugs and compliance
5. **Deployment Phase:** Release the finished product to users
6. **Maintenance Phase:** Provide ongoing support and handle issues

## Key Agile Terms

**Agile Manifesto:** The foundational document outlining Agile values and principles.

**User Story:** A simple description of what a user wants 

**Backlog:** The team's prioritized to-do list of all features, bugs, and improvements.

**Sprint:** A short work period (1-4 weeks) where the team focuses on specific tasks.

**Epic:** A large feature or idea that gets broken down into smaller user stories.

**Feature:** A useful capability or function in the product.

**Task:** A small, specific step needed to complete a user story.

**Sprint Planning:** Meeting to decide what work gets done in the next sprint.

**Daily Standup:** Quick daily meeting to share progress and identify blockers.

**Sprint Review:** Meeting where the team demonstrates completed work to get feedback.

**Sprint Retrospective:** Meeting to discuss what went well and what can be improved.

**Acceptance Criteria:** Conditions that define when work is considered "done".

**Product Owner:** Person who represents customer needs and sets priorities.

**Scrum Master:** Team facilitator who removes obstacles and guides the Agile process.

**Kanban Board:** Visual tool showing what's to do, in progress, and completed.

**Work in Progress (WIP):** Tasks that have been started but aren't finished yet.

**Iteration:** Another term for sprint; a repeatable work cycle.

**Definition of Done:** Shared checklist of criteria for completing work.

**Velocity:** Measure of how much work a team completes in each sprint.


## When to Use Each Method

**Use Agile When:**
- Requirements may change or are unclear
- Customer feedback is crucial throughout development
- You need to deliver value quickly and frequently
- Working on innovative or complex projects
- Team collaboration and flexibility are important

**Use Waterfall When:**
- Requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change
- Regulatory compliance requires extensive documentation
- Working with fixed budgets and strict timelines
- The project scope is clear and stable
- Team has limited experience with iterative methods


## Benefits and Drawbacks

**Agile Benefits:**
- Faster delivery of working features
- Better response to changing requirements
- Improved team collaboration and communication
- Higher customer satisfaction through regular feedback
- Reduced project risk through early problem detection

**Agile Drawbacks:**
- Can be challenging without experienced team members
- Less predictable timelines and budgets
- Requires active customer involvement
- May lack comprehensive documentation

**Waterfall Benefits:**
- Clear project structure and milestones
- Predictable timelines and budgets
- Comprehensive documentation
- Works well for regulatory environments
- Easy to manage and understand

**Waterfall Drawbacks:**
- Limited flexibility for changes
- Late discovery of issues
- No working product until the end
- Assumes requirements won't change
- High risk if initial requirements are wrong
